# TeamCity Test

This is a repository for testing out TeamCity CI/CD pipelines. The Java application included is a basic HTTP server, nothing fancy. The main thing we're focusing on is proving that our TeamCity setup is working. Building is done with Gradle that uses a Kotlin Script based build file, Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml are also ready for deployment.
